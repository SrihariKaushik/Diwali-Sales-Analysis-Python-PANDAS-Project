# Diwali-Sales-Analysis-Python-PANDAS-Project
Project Workflow:
Data Preprocessing: The Diwali sales dataset is cleaned and organized, with Pandas used for data manipulation, handling missing values, and organizing data types to prepare it for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization: Pandas is used to perform exploratory data analysis, generating insights such as:
Sales by Product Category: Understanding which product categories are most popular during Diwali.
Revenue by Region: Analyzing which regions contribute most to overall sales.
Customer Demographics: Identifying key customer demographics such as age group, gender, and location.
Time-based Trends: Observing sales patterns leading up to Diwali and during the festival.

Key Insights for Strategic Planning: The analysis provides a foundation for marketing and inventory strategies by highlighting consumer preferences, high-performing products, and optimal marketing windows.

This project offers valuable insights for retailers and marketers, helping them optimize sales strategies and inventory planning to maximize revenue during the Diwali season.
